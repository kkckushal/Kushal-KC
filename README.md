#### You can always count on me when you need someone to help with your problems. I will give my 100% to help you out.               I would like to motivate the group. It's just the beginning. With a lot of hardwork we can make the best out of this journey.
##### "There was this one guy in my class that was constantly making fun of me. One day, after I couldnâ€™t take it any more, I pulled out my phone and acted like I was talking to snipers who were trained to follow around people who were mean to me. He thought it was for real. I still cringe myself into a ball whenever I think about it."
###### " It was a terrible idea. I still regret doing it"
